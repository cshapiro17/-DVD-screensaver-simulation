# Screen Saver

The given program plays a screen saver that has nine dual-colored circles endlessly bounce off the walls and each other.

You have two options for this activity:
1. Build off of the starter code:
    * Make the bubbles change color as they move
    * Add a second layer of bubbles (which will bounce off each other but will overlap with the given bubbles)
    * Randomize the size of each bubble (and see how the collisions change)
2. Create your own screen saver:
    * You do not need to use the given circle program
    * Your program should be endlessly mesmerizing without requiring user input
    
You have 30 minutes to work on this activity. After that time is up, we will have everyone share what they have: everyone will run their programs and walk around to see what other people made.
